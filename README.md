nodejs-mysql-boilerplate
========================

Very basic nodejs/express setup with mysql authentication.

I found mongodb based boilerplates but I needed something that would work with mysql. I quickly threw this together and I'm sure this could use some cleanup, so feel free to make any recommendations that you would like.  I hope you find this useful.

NOTE: I've included the table structure I used in users.sql.  If you already have your own, just adjust the code as you see fit.
